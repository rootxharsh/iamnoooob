### Hi there 👋

This is Rahul! 

- 🔭 I’m really interested in Application/Cloud Security and Source Code Reviews, also I do [bug](https://bugcrowd.com/noob)  [bounties](https://hackerone.com/iamnoooob) [sometimes](https://app.cobalt.io/iamnoob). 

- 🌱 Currently learning Java specific attacks and how to approach Java based applications from security code review perspective.

- 👯 I’m usually seen collaborating with [@rootxharsh](https://github.com/rootxharsh) to find 0days or reverse N-days(CVEs) for fun & learning [here](https://github.com/iamnoooob/CVE-Reverse/)
